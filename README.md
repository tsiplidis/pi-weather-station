# pi weather station
Code about weather stations built in schools
In 2016 several schools around the world, had the opportunity of building a complete weather station using a raspberry pi.
The Raspberry Pi Foundation in cooperation with Oracle donated a set of sensors and a Pi unit and helped us setup a complete weather station. 
Each station is online, records a number of weather data and uploads them on a dedicated server within the Pi and in a central Oracle Datbase.

The code presented here is focusing on making a map with all live Weather Stations around the world.
